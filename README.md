How to make a calculator program using c#


# Introduction

C# is an object-oriented, modern programming language that was created by Microsoft. It runs on the .NET Framework. The first version of C# was released in 2002. Static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming are all C# programming domains.


# Step 1 — Prompt Users for Input and convert to Integer

# Step 3 — Adding Operators
 Add a total of four mathematical operations: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division.

# Step 4 — Adding Conditional Statements

Proceed by including some information at the top of the program, along with a choice to make, so that the user knows what to do.

The operator chosen will subsequently be used for the operation and this can be done by using switch case condition
